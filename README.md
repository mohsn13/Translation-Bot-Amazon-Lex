# Translation Bot Created Using Amazon Lex

In this project, I built a language translation bot using Amazon Lex.

The language translation bot developed using AWS services such as - 


_Amazon Lex_ - Amazon Lex is utilized to build conversational interfaces (chatbots) using natural language understanding (NLU). It acts as the frontend interface where users interact with the translation bot.

_AWS Lambda_ - AWS Lambda is used for serverless computing, enabling the execution of code in response to events without the need to provision or manage servers. Lambda functions are employed to handle the backend logic of the translation bot, including integrating with Amazon Translate and processing user input.

_Amazon Translate_ -  Amazon Translate is a neural machine translation service that provides fast and accurate translation of text between languages. It is utilized by the translation bot to perform language translation based on user input.

_AWS IAM_ (Identity and Access Management) - AWS IAM is employed to manage access to AWS services securely. IAM roles and policies are defined to ensure that the translation bot has the necessary permissions to interact with other AWS services while adhering to the principle of least privilege.
